## General info
This project is my first project of trying to build an Android App that allows the user to record and track their expenses. 
This app supports Android 4.2 as the minimum system requirement.
	
## Technologies
This project has used Java and XML.
I used Android Room Persistence Library as its local database.
	
## Setup
To run this project, clone the repository into Android Studio and run this app either on your smartphone or an emnulator.
For more details on how to do this, refer to Google's documentation on Android Studio.
